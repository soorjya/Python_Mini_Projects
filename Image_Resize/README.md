# Image Resize Program

This is a Python program that resizes an image using the PIL library.

## Description

The Image Resize Program is a Python script that takes an image file as input, resizes it to the specified dimensions, and saves the resized image as a new file. It uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) library to perform the image resizing operation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install Pillow`.
4. Place the image file you want to resize in the same directory as the script.
5. Run the program using `python image_resize.py`.
6. Enter the desired width and length for the resized image when prompted.
7. The program will display the current size of the image.
8. The resized image will be saved as a new file with a filename based on the provided dimensions.

## Example

```bash
$ python image_resize.py
Enter Width: 800
Enter Length: 600
Current size: (1024, 768)
Resized image saved as 'test-800x600.jpeg'

```
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
